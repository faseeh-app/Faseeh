Faseeh is a desktop language learning toolkit that turns content you love‚Äîvideos, articles, and books‚Äîinto your personal study material. It's designed for the self-driven learner who is tired of generic lessons and wants to immerse themselves in authentic content.

Instead of juggling multiple applications, Faseeh provides a unified **framework** to bring learning tools together. It creates a cohesive, distraction-free environment where functionality, delivered via plugins, can work in harmony.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Please Note:** This project is in its early development stages. The core framework and interfaces shown below are a functional proof of concept. The true power of Faseeh is realized through its plugin system, which is ready for future expansion.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Import from Web or Local Files:** Add learning material by pasting a URL or selecting files directly from your computer.
- **Custom Media Viewers:** Plugins can define entirely new viewers for different media types, allowing for unique interfaces beyond the default text and media players.
- **Powerful Plugin System:** A built-in manager lets you enable or disable plugins to add new functionalities, from content adapters to dictionaries.
- **Language-Agnostic Core:** The base app provides the framework; plugins provide the language-specific tools.
- **Fully Customizable:** Tailor your experience with settings for appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and plugin configurations.
- **Private & Local-First:** All your data, content, and progress are stored securely on your own machine.
